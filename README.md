## 👋 Hi, I am  <a href="https://spchai.github.io/">Shupeng CHAI (柴术鹏, 柴術鵬)</a>

I am a PhD candidate in geotechnical engineering at [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I am currently focusing on the **influences of fault roughness on rupture dynamics and stick-slip behavior** through integrated **laboratory experiments** and **numerical simulations**. My interdisciplinary academic foundation spanning geotechnical engineering, mining engineering, and geophysics, and two years of experience in university-level teaching, bring a unique perspective to my research. My research interests include

* Rock mechanics and geophysics
* Geotechnical engineering
* Planetary Geomechanics (e.g., Lunar landslides)
* Interaction between rock and mining backfill

Education
------
* 2023–2026 (expected), PhD in Geotechnical Engineering, [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/)
* 2018–2020, MASc in Mineral Engineering, [University of Montreal (Polytechnique Montréal)](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/)
* 2014–2018, BEng in Civil Engineering, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/)
